# CompilerCompiler
Compiler Course Project
## Running
First make sure you have flex installed.  
Running is pretty simple:  
```shell
make
make run
```
## things that must be do
1- fix the bug of ***Rectype*** ( we must change the rules of lines of 5, 10, 13 for example we must add *id id* rule)
ofcourse we can solve this problem using lexer, in this way that when we see ***Record*** token in lexer, we save next token as a Type in a new table in the name of *** Records names ***

2- do the third phase of Project.

3- create 3 versions of Project for presentation time
